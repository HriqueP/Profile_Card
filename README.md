# GreatFrontEnd - Blog Card

Welcome, this is a simples example for a Profile Card Component

## My Starting Steps

- Dowload all the content availeble
- Analisy the component for a few minutes just to get a basic ideia on how to approach the problem

### Using Figma files

Using the Figma file is much easier to get the exact number for padding, borders and gaps. I also was able to indentify colors for background, text, borders and etc.

## Working on the challenge

- Think about the design first
- Place all the element on the screen
- Define the basic shape
- Work from top to bottom
- Details and minor adjustmants are the last thing
